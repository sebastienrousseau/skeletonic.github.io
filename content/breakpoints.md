Most CSS frameworks expose a 4–5 step breakpoint ladder
(`xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`). Skeletonic does not.

Instead, the `.container` width adapts through **38 `min-width` media
queries** from `13.75em` (220 px) to `480em` (7680 px). The container
gradually settles into a comfortable measure at every viewport size,
so layouts work on phones, tablets, laptops, ultrawide monitors, and
projection walls without you defining a single breakpoint yourself.

## Why so many?

Two reasons:

1. **There is no single "right" breakpoint** for every project. Modern
   container queries finally fix this at the component level, but the
   page-level container still needs to choose a measure. Picking 38
   small steps makes the wrong choice less wrong than picking 4 big
   ones.
2. **`em`-based queries adapt to user preference.** Each query is
   `em`-relative — a user who has set their root font-size to 24 px
   gets larger thresholds automatically, so the layout reflows when
   *their* text needs more room, not when your designer thought it
   would.

## You don't have to think about them

The 38 steps are a default the `.container` uses internally. If you
write your own component CSS, prefer **container queries** for
component-level responsiveness — they're now Baseline (Chrome 105+,
Safari 16+, Firefox 110+):

```css
.card {
  container-type: inline-size;
}

@container (min-width: 30em) {
  .card { padding: 2rem; }
}
```

For page-level responsiveness, the standard breakpoints most teams
reach for are `48em` (≈ 768 px, tablet portrait), `64em` (≈ 1024 px,
laptop), and `80em` (≈ 1280 px, desktop). Skeletonic's 38-step ladder
absorbs all of these, plus the cracks between them.

## The full range

The lowest threshold is `13.75em` (220 px — feature phones, smartwatch
detail views). The highest is `480em` (7680 px — 8K projection or
billboard displays). Between them, every sensible web viewport size
has at least one matching step.

If you need to inspect the exact ladder, it's generated from a single
`for` loop in
[`src/stylus/layout/media-queries.styl`](https://github.com/sebastienrousseau/skeletonic-stylus/blob/main/src/stylus/layout/media-queries.styl).
